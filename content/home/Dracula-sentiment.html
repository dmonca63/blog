<p>For this post, we are going to learn how to do text mining using Gutenberg downloads - Dracula. In this project, we will be introducing new packages: -reshape2 and -wordcloud2.</p>
<p>Reshape2 is a flexibly restructure and aggregate data using just two functions: melt and ‘dcast’ (or ‘acast’). Acast or dcast, which we will use ‘acast’ further in this project is Use acast or dcast depending on whether you want vector/matrix/array output or data frame out- put. Data frames can have at most two dimensions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, wordcloud2 is a package that provides an HTML5 interface to wordcloud for data visualization.</p>
<p>To start, let’s take a look on how we can download the Dracula book and create a dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula&lt;-gutenberg_download(345)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-dracula%&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word,text)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>bing&lt;-get_sentiments(&#39;bing&#39;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-inner_join(dracula_words,bing)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words$gutenberg_id&lt;-NULL</code></pre>
<div id="comparison-wordcloud" class="section level2">
<h2>Comparison wordcloud</h2>
<p>Plot a cloud comparing the frequencies of words across documents.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dracula_words&lt;-dracula_words%&gt;%
  group_by(word)%&gt;%
  summarize(freq=n(),sentiment=first(sentiment))</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>wordcloud(dracula_words$word,dracula_words$freq,min.freq=5)</code></pre>
